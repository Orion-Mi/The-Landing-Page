                <p>We are the organisms too small to be seen without using a special-microscope, and we include tribes like bacteria, archaea, and single cell eukaryotes — cells that have a nucleus, like an amoeba or a paramecium. We also consider viruses as one of Us.</p>

                    <h4>ARE MICROBES ANIMALS?</h4> <!--Placeholder-->
                    <p>Nope. Microbes are single-celled organisms.</p>
                    <p>Animal is a name reserved for multicellular eukaryotes that are heterotrophic, so organisms that are bigger than a single cell and almost all their cells have a nucleus.</p>

                    <h4>ARE MICROBES BACTERIA?</h4> <!--Placeholder-->
                    <p>No, not exclusively. Bacteria are microbes, but not all microbes are bacteria.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>ARE YEAST MICROBES?</h4>
                    <p>Yes - they're very tiny fungal cells.  And we love yeasts because we love beer and wine and bread! </p>

                <div class="box">
                    <h4>ARE MICROBES DANGEROUS?</h4> <!--Placeholder-->
                    <p>Not as dangerous as we used to think. </p>
                    <p>The grand majority of microbes are either not in contact with us or, if they are in contact with us, they’re actually mutualistic, which means that we gain a benefit from them, they gain a benefit from us. Or they’re simply neutral. </p>

                    <h4>ARE MICROBES IMPORTANT?</h4><!--Placeholder-->
                    <p>We wouldn’t be here without them. Every oxygen molecule we inhale is made by a microbe or a descendant of a microbe. The protein in our body got to us through microbes. </p>
                    <p>Plants wouldn’t be here either. Or potato chips. Or cheese. Or beer.</p>
